# AI_MICROSCOPE
Ai-aided microscope workstation

AI-Assisted Workstation for Rapid Bacterial Species Identification
📌 Project Overview
In resource-constrained clinical settings, identifying bacterial pathogens traditionally takes 48 to 72 hours through culture methods. This delay often leads to empirical prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics, fueling Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).
This project introduces an Offline AI-Assisted Workstation designed for the Microbiology Laboratory at Mbeya Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH). Using a Deep Learning model (EfficientNet), the system identifies 33 bacterial species directly from digital Gram-stain microscopy images in seconds. It provides laboratory technicians with a "digital second opinion," reducing diagnostic turnaround time (TAT) and human error.
✨ Key Features
 * Offline Inference: No internet connection required, ensuring reliability in regional hospital settings.
 * High-Speed Identification: Species-level classification in under 5 seconds.
 * Explainable AI (Grad-CAM): Visual heatmaps highlight the specific bacterial clusters used by the AI to make its decision, building trust with clinicians.
 * Integrated Patient Registry: A built-in SQLite database logs patient IDs, timestamps, and diagnostic results for easy export and audit trails.
 * User-Friendly GUI: A modern dashboard built with CustomTkinter for easy operation by lab staff.
🔬 Scientific Background
The core of the workstation is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the EfficientNet-B0 architecture.
 * Dataset: Trained on the Digital Bacterial System (DiBaS) dataset.
 * Classes: 33 species (including S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, etc.).
 * Explainability: Uses Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize morphological features recognized by the model.
🛠️ Tech Stack
 * Language: Python 3.11
 * Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras
 * Computer Vision: OpenCV
 * UI/UX: CustomTkinter (Modernized Tkinter)
 * Database: SQLite3
 * Imaging: Pillow (PIL)
